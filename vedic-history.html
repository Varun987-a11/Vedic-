                    The term **Veda** itself derives from the Sanskrit root *vid*, meaning "to know" or "knowledge." These texts represent the earliest literary record of Indo-Aryan civilization and are considered to be among the world's most ancient scriptures.

It is a collection of prayers and praises directed at personified natural deities like Agni (Fire) and Indra (King of Gods), and it includes profound speculative texts like the <a href="nasadiya-svara.html" class="underline text-amber-gold hover:text-white transition duration-200">Nāsadīya Sūktam</a>.

Primarily a liturgical text containing **formulas and mantras** to be recited by the priest (*Adhvaryu*) while performing sacrificial rituals (*Yajñas*). It is divided into two main schools: **Shukla** (White, clear verses) and **Krishna** (Black, mixed verses and prose commentary).

It is considered the foundation of Indian classical music.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    While the main texts that survive are considered highly pure due to the precision of the oral tradition, it is widely acknowledged that much of the complete Vedic corpus has been lost over time.

                        <span class="key-term">The Recensions (*Shākhās*):</span> In ancient times, the Vedas were taught and preserved across numerous schools or **recensions (*Shākhās*)**, each with its own slightly varying version of the texts, particularly the *Brāhmaṇas*.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key-term">The Scale of Loss:</span> Puranic texts suggest that originally there were over **1,100 *Shākhās*** across all four Vedas (e.g., Rigveda had 21, Samaveda had 1,000). Today, only about **12 to 13 *Shākhās*** survive in their entirety.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="key-term">Reasons for the Loss:</span> The vast majority of this material was lost due to a confluence of factors:
                        <ul class="list-circle list-inside mt-2 ml-4 text-sm space-y-1">
                            <li>The immense difficulty and high cost of maintaining specialized oral traditions for less popular recensions.</li>
                            <li>Socio-political shifts leading to the dominance and survival of only a few major schools.</li>
                            <li>The perishable nature of early manuscripts (birch bark and palm leaves), making texts vulnerable to climate and destruction across centuries.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 italic text-gray-400">
                    Despite this loss, the surviving core texts—especially the *Samhitās* and major *Upaniṣads*—provide an invaluable and surprisingly complete foundation for understanding the entire trajectory of Hindu philosophy.
